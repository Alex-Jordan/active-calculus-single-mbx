      <p>A person walking along a straight path has her velocity in miles per hour at time <m>t</m> given by the function <m>v(t) = 0.25t^3-1.5t^2+3t+0.25</m>, for times in the interval <m>0 \le t \le 2</m>. The graph of this function is also given in each of the three diagrams in <xref ref="F-4-2-PA1">Figure</xref>.</p>

      <p>Note that in each diagram, we use four rectangles to estimate the area under <m>y = v(t)</m> on the interval <m>[0,2]</m>, but the method by which the four rectangles' respective heights are decided varies among the three individual graphs.

      <ol label="a.">
        <li><p>How are the heights of rectangles in the left-most diagram being chosen?  Explain, and hence determine the value of

            </me>
            by evaluating the function <m>y = v(t)</m> at appropriately chosen values and observing the width of each rectangle.  Note, for example, that
            <me>
              A_3 = v(1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1.
