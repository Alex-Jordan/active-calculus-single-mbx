A function <m>f</m> defined on <m>-4 \lt  x \lt  4</m> is given by the graph in <xref ref="F-1-7-PA1">Figure</xref>. Use the graph to answer each of the following questions. Note: to the right of <m>x = 2</m>, the graph of <m>f</m> is exhibiting infinite oscillatory behavior similar to the function <m>\sin(\frac{\pi}{x})</m> that we encountered in the key example early in <xref ref="sec-1-2-lim">Section</xref>.

    <li><p>For each of the values <m>a = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3</m>, determine whether or not <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m> exists.  If the function has a limit <m>L</m> at a given point, state the value of the limit using the notation <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L</m>.  If the function does not have a limit at a given point, write a sentence to explain why.</p></li>
    <li><p>For each of the values of <m>a</m> from part (a) where <m>f</m> has a limit, determine the value of <m>f(a)</m> at each such point.  In addition, for each such <m>a</m> value, does <m>f(a)</m> have the same value as <m>\lim_{x \to a} f(x)</m>?</p></li>
    <li><p>For each of the values <m>a = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3</m>, determine whether or not <m>f'(a)</m> exists.  In particular, based on the given graph, ask yourself if it is reasonable to say that <m>f</m> has a tangent line at <m>(a,f(a))</m> for each of the given <m>a</m>-values.  If so, visually estimate the slope of the tangent line to find the value of <m>f'(a)</m>.</p></li>
