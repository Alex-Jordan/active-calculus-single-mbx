    Consider the function <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>.
    <ol label="a.">
        <li><p>Use the limit definition to compute the following derivative values:  <m>f'(0)</m>, <m>f'(1)</m>, <m>f'(2)</m>, and <m>f'(3)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Observe that the work to find <m>f'(a)</m> is the same, regardless of the value of <m>a</m>.  Based on your work in (a), what do you conjecture is the value of <m>f'(4)</m>?  How about <m>f'(5)</m>?  (Note: you should <em>not</em> use the limit definition of the derivative to find either value.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Conjecture a formula for <m>f'(a)</m> that depends only on the value <m>a</m>.  That is, in the same way that we have a formula for <m>f(x)</m> (recall <m>f(x) = 4x - x^2</m>), see if you can use your work above to guess a formula for <m>f'(a)</m> in terms of <m>a</m>.</p></li>
