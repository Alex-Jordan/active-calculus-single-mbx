Consider the function <m>g(x) = 2^x</m>, which is graphed in <xref ref="F-2-2-PA1">Figure</xref>.
    <ol label="a.">
        <li><p>At each of <m>x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2</m>, use a straightedge to sketch an accurate tangent line to <m>y = g(x)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Use the provided grid to estimate the slope of the tangent line you drew at each point in (a).</p></li>
        <li><p>Use the limit definition of the derivative to estimate <m>g'(0)</m> by using small values of <m>h</m>, and compare the result to your visual estimate for the slope of the tangent line to <m>y = g(x)</m> at <m>x = 0</m> in (b).</p></li>
        <li><p>Based on your work in (a), (b), and (c), sketch an accurate graph of <m>y = g'(x)</m> on the axes adjacent to the graph of <m>y = g(x)</m>.</p></li>
        <li><p>Write at least one sentence that explains why it is reasonable to think that <m>g'(x) = cg(x)</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant.  In addition, calculate <m>\ln(2)</m>, and then discuss how this value, combined with your work above, reasonably suggests that <m>g'(x) = 2^x \ln(2)</m>.</p></li>
