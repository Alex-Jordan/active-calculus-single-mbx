      <p>Recall that one model for population growth states that a population grows at a rate proportional to its size.

      <ol label="a">
        <li><p>We begin with the differential equation
            <me>
              \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac12 P.
            </me>
            Sketch a slope field below as well as a few typical solutions on the axes provided.

        <li><p>Find all equilibrium solutions of the equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac12 P</m> and classify them as stable or
              unstable.</p></li>

        <li><p>Let's now consider a modified differential equation given by

              \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac 12 P(3-P).
            </me>
            As before, sketch a slope field as well as a few typical solutions on the following axes provided.

        <li><p>Find any equilibrium solutions and classify them as stable or
