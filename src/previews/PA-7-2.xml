      <p>Let's consider the initial value problem
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = t - 2, \ \ y(0) = 1.
      </me>

      <ol label="a">
        <li><p>Use the differential equation to find the slope of the tangent
              line to the solution <m>y(t)</m> at <m>t=0</m>.  Then use the initial value to
              find the equation of the tangent line at <m>t=0</m>.  Sketch this tangent
              line over the interval <m>-0.25 \leq t \leq 0.25</m> on the axes provided.</p>

          </li>

        <li><p>Also shown in <xref ref="F-7-2-PA">Figure</xref> are the tangent lines to the solution <m>y(t)</m> at
              the points <m>t=1, 2,</m> and <m>3</m> (we will see how to find these later).
              Use the graph to measure the slope of each tangent line  
              and verify that each agrees with the value specified by the differential
              equation.</p></li>

        <li><p>Using these tangent lines as a guide, sketch a graph of the
              solution <m>y(t)</m> over the interval <m>0\leq t\leq 3</m> so that the lines
              are tangent to the graph of <m>y(t)</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find <m>y(t)</m>, the
              solution to this initial value problem.</p></li>

        <li><p>Graph the solution you found in (d) on the axes provided, and compare it to the sketch
              you made using the tangent lines.</p></li>
