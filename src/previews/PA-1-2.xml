        Suppose that <m>g</m> is the function given by the graph below. Use the graph to answer each of the following questions.
        <ol label="a.">
        <li><p>Determine the values <m>g(-2)</m>, <m>g(-1)</m>, <m>g(0)</m>, <m>g(1)</m>, and <m>g(2)</m>, if defined.  If the function value is not defined, explain what feature of the graph tells you this.</p></li>
        <li><p>For each of the values <m>a = -1</m>, <m>a = 0</m>, and <m>a = 2</m>, complete the following sentence: <q>As <m>x</m> gets closer and closer (but not equal) to <m>a</m>, <m>g(x)</m> gets as close as we want to <fillin />.</q></p></li>
        <li><p>What happens as <m>x</m> gets closer and closer (but not equal) to <m>a = 1</m>?  Does the function <m>g(x)</m> get as close as we would like to a single value?</p></li>
        </ol>
