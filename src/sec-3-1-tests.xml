In many different settings, we are interested in knowing where a function achieves its least and greatest values. These can be important in applications <mdash /> say to identify a point at which maximum profit or minimum cost occurs <mdash /> or in theory to understand how to characterize the behavior of a function or a family of related functions. Consider the simple and familiar example of a parabolic function such as <m>s(t) = -16t^2 + 32t + 48</m> (shown at left in <xref ref="F-3-1-Intro">Figure</xref>) that represents the height of an object tossed vertically: its maximum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola and represents the highest value that the object reaches. Moreover, this maximum value identifies an especially important point on the graph, the point at which the curve changes from increasing to decreasing.

<p>
More generally, for any function we consider, we can investigate where its lowest and highest points occur in comparison to points nearby or to all possible points on the graph. Given a function <m>f</m>, we say that <m>f(c)</m> is a <em>global</em> or <em>absolute maximum</em> <index><main>maximum</main><sub>global</sub></index> <index><main>maximum</main><sub>absolute</sub></index> provided that <m>f(c) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>, and similarly call <m>f(c)</m> a <em>global</em> <index><main>minimum</main><sub>global</sub></index> or <em>absolute minimum</em> <index><main>minimum</main><sub>absolute</sub></index> whenever <m>f(c) \le f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> in the domain of <m>f</m>. For instance, for the function <m>g</m> given at right in <xref ref="F-3-1-Intro">Figure</xref>, <m>g</m> has a global maximum of <m>g(c)</m>, but <m>g</m> does not appear to have a global minimum, as the graph of <m>g</m> seems to decrease without bound. We note that the point <m>(c,g(c))</m> marks a fundamental change in the behavior of <m>g</m>, where <m>g</m> changes from increasing to decreasing; similar things happen at both <m>(a,g(a))</m> and <m>(b,g(b))</m>, although these points are not global mins or maxes.
</p>

<p>
For any function <m>f</m>, we say that <m>f(c)</m> is a <em>local maximum</em> <index><main>maximum</main><sub>local</sub></index> or <em>relative maximum</em> <index><main>maximum</main><sub>relative</sub></index> provided that <m>f(c) \ge f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>, while <m>f(c)</m> is called a <em>local</em> <index><main>minimum</main><sub>local</sub></index> or <em>relative minimum</em> <index><main>minimum</main><sub>relative</sub></index> whenever <m>f(c) \le f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>. Any maximum or minimum may be called an <em>extreme value</em> <index><main>extreme value</main></index> of <m>f</m>. For example, in <xref ref="F_3.1.Intro">Figure</xref>, <m>g</m> has a relative minimum of <m>g(b)</m> at the point <m>(b,g(b))</m> and a relative maximum of <m>g(a)</m> at <m>(a,g(a))</m>. We have already identified the global maximum of <m>g</m> as <m>g(c)</m>; this global maximum can also be considered a relative maximum.
</p>

<p>
We would like to use fundamental calculus ideas to help us identify and classify key function behavior, including the location of relative extremes. Of course, if we are given a graph of a function, it is often straightforward to locate these important behaviors visually. We investigate this situation in the following preview activity.

<subsection>
<title>Critical numbers and the first derivative test</title>
<p>
If a function has a relative extreme value at a point <m>(c,f(c))</m>, the function must change its behavior at <m>c</m> regarding whether it is increasing or decreasing before or after the point.
</p>
<figure xml:id="F-3-1-extremes" >
<caption>From left to right, a function with a relative maximum where its derivative is zero; a function with a relative maximum where its derivative is undefined; a function with neither a maximum nor a minimum at a point where its derivative is zero; a function with a relative minimum where its derivative is zero; and a function with a relative minimum where its derivative is undefined.</caption>

<p>
For example, if a continuous function has a relative maximum at <m>c</m>, such as those pictured in the two leftmost functions in <xref ref="F-3-1-extremes">Figure</xref>, then it is both necessary and sufficient that the function change from being increasing just before <m>c</m> to decreasing just after <m>c</m>. In the same way, a continuous function has a relative minimum at <m>c</m> if and only if the function changes from decreasing to increasing at <m>c</m>. See, for instance, the two functions pictured at right in <xref ref="F-3-1-extremes">Figure</xref>. There are only two possible ways for these changes in behavior to occur: either <m>f'(c) = 0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined.
</p>

<p>
Because these values of <m>c</m> are so important, we call them <em>critical numbers</em>. More specifically, we say that a function <m>f</m> has a <em>critical number</em> <index><main>critical number</main></index> at <m>x = c</m> provided that <m>c</m> is in the domain of <m>f</m>, and <m>f'(c) = 0</m> or <m>f'(c)</m> is undefined. Critical numbers provide us with the only possible locations where the function <m>f</m> may have relative extremes. Note that not every critical number produces a maximum or minimum; in the middle graph of <xref ref="F-3-1-extremes">Figure</xref>, the function pictured there has a horizontal tangent line at the noted point, but the function is increasing before and increasing after, so the critical number does not yield a location where the function is greater than every value nearby, nor less than every value nearby.
</p>

<p>
We also sometimes use the terminology that, when <m>c</m> is a critical number, that <m>(c,f(c))</m> is a <em>critical point</em> <index><main>critical point</main></index> of the function, or that <m>f(c)</m> is a <em>critical value</em> <index><main>critical value</main></index>.
</p>

<p>
The <em>first derivative test</em> <index><main>first derivative test</main></index> summarizes how sign changes in the first derivative indicate the presence of a local maximum or minimum for a given function.
</p>

<aside xml:id="First-D-Test">
	<title>First Derivative Test<index><main>first derivative test</main></index></title>
	<p>If <m>p</m> is a critical number of a continuous function <m>f</m> that is differentiable near <m>p</m> (except possibly at <m>x = p</m>), then <m>f</m> has a relative maximum at <m>p</m> if and only if <m>f'</m> changes sign from positive to negative at <m>p</m>, and <m>f</m> has a relative minimum at <m>p</m> if and only if <m>f'</m> changes sign from negative to positive at <m>p</m>.</p>
</aside>	


<p>
We consider an example to show one way the first derivative test can be used to identify the relative extreme values of a function.
</p>

<example xml:id="Ex-f-from-f-prime">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>f</m> be a function whose derivative is given by the formula <m>f'(x) = e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2</m>. Determine all critical numbers of <m>f</m> and decide whether a relative maximum, relative minimum, or neither occurs at each.
</p>
</statement>
<solution>

<p>
Since we already have <m>f'(x)</m> written in factored form, it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of <m>f</m>. Since <m>f'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>, we need only determine where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>. From the equation
<me>
  e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2 = 0
</me>
and the zero product property, it follows that <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = -1</m> are critical numbers of <m>f</m>. (Note particularly that there is no value of <m>x</m> that makes <m>e^{-2x} = 0</m>.)
</p>

<p>
Next, to apply the first derivative test, we'd like to know the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> at inputs near the critical numbers. Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which <m>f'</m> can change sign, it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers: for instance, the sign of <m>f'</m> must be the same for every <m>x \lt  -1</m>. We create a first derivative sign chart to summarize the sign of <m>f'</m> on the relevant intervals along with the corresponding behavior of <m>f</m>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="F-3-1-signchart" >
<caption>The first derivative sign chart for a function <m>f</m> whose derivative is given by the formula <m>f'(x) = e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2</m>.</caption>
<image width="100%" source="images/3_1_signchart" />
</figure>
<p>
The first derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart">Figure</xref> comes from thinking about the sign of each of the terms in the factored form of <m>f'(x)</m> at one selected point in the interval under consideration. For instance, for <m>x \lt  -1</m>, we could consider <m>x = -2</m> and determine the sign of <m>e^{-2x}</m>, <m>(3-x)</m>, and <m>(x+1)^2</m> at the value <m>x = -2</m>. We note that both <m>e^{-2x}</m> and <m>(x+1)^2</m> are positive regardless of the value of <m>x</m>, while <m>(3-x)</m> is also positive at <m>x = -2</m>. Hence, each of the three terms in <m>f'</m> is positive, which we indicate by writing <q><m>+++</m>.</q> Taking the product of three positive terms obviously results in a value that is positive, which we denote by the <q><m>+</m></q> in the interval to the left of <m>x = -1</m> indicating the overall sign of <m>f'</m>. And, since <m>f'</m> is positive on that interval, we further know that <m>f</m> is increasing, which we summarize by writing <q>INC</q> to represent the corresponding behavior of <m>f</m>. In a similar way, we find that <m>f'</m> is positive and <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>-1 \lt  x \lt  3</m>, and <m>f'</m> is negative and <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \gt 3</m>.
</p>

<p>
Now, by the first derivative test, to find relative extremes of <m>f</m> we look for critical numbers at which <m>f'</m> changes sign. In this example, <m>f'</m> only changes sign at <m>x = 3</m>, where <m>f'</m> changes from positive to negative, and thus <m>f</m> has a relative maximum at <m>x = 3</m>. While <m>f</m> has a critical number at <m>x = -1</m>, since <m>f</m> is increasing both before and after <m>x = -1</m>, <m>f</m> has neither a minimum nor a maximum at <m>x = -1</m>.
