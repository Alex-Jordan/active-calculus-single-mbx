 Use the figure below, which gives a graph of the function \(f(x)\),
to give values for the indicated limits.  If a limit does not exist,
enter {\it {\bf none}} .

\par \par {\bf Solution: }\par  SOLUTION \par 

{\bf (a)}
As \(x\) approaches \(-2\) from either side, the values of
\(f(x)\) get closer and closer to \(-6\), so the limit appears
to be about \(-6\).
\par 

{\bf (b)}
As \(x\) approaches 0 from either side, the values of \(f(x)\) get
closer and closer to \(-10\).  (Recall that to find a limit, we are
interested in what happens to the function near \(x\) but not at \(x\).)
The limit appears to be about \(-10\).
\par 

{\bf (c)}
As \(x\) approaches 2 from either side, the values of \(f(x)\) get
closer and closer to \(-6\) on one side of \(x = 2\) and get
closer and closer to \(7\) on the other side of \(x = 2\).
Thus the limit does not exist.
\par 

{\bf (d)}
As \(x\) approaches 4 from either side, the values of \(f(x)\) get
closer and closer to 11.  (Again, recall that we don't care what
happens right at \(x = 4\).)  The limit appears to be about 11.
