    <li><p><m>F'(30) \approx = 3.85</m> degrees per minute.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>F'(60) \approx = 1.56</m> degrees per minute.</p></li>

    <li><p>The value <m>F(64) = 330.28</m> is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit at time 64, while <m>F'(64) = 1.341</m> measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant <m>t = 64</m>, and its units are degrees per minute.  Because at time <m>t = 64</m> the potato's temperature is increasing at 1.341 degrees per minute, we expect that at <m>t = 65</m>, the temperature will be about 1.341 degrees greater than at <m>t = 64</m>, or in other words <m>F(65) \approx 330.28 + 1.341 = 331.621</m>.  Similarly, at <m>t = 66</m>, two minutes have elapsed from <m>t = 64</m>, so we expect an increase of <m>2 \dot 1.341</m> degrees:  <m>F(66) \approx 330.28 + 2 \cdot 1.341 = 332.962</m>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Throughout the time interval <m>[0,90]</m>, the temperature <m>F</m> of the potato is increasing.  But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising appears to be decreasing.  That is, while the values of <m>F</m> continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of <m>F'</m> are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that <q>the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.</q></p></li>

  <ol label="a">
    <li><p>Using the central difference, we find that
    <me>
      F'(30) \approx \frac{F(45)-F(15)}{45-15} = \frac{296-180.5}{30} = 3.85
    </me>
    degrees per minute.</p></li>
    <li><p>Using the central difference, we find that
    <me>
      F'(60) \approx \frac{F(75)-F(45)}{45-15} = \frac{342.8-296}{30} = 1.56
    </me>
    degrees per minute.</p></li>
    <li><p>Over each subsequent time interval, we see that the amount of increase in the potato's temperature gets less and less, thus we expect the value of <m>F'(t)</m> to get smaller and smaller as time goes on.  We therefore expect <m>F'(75) > F'(90)</m>.</p></li>
