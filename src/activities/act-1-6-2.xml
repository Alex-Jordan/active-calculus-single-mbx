<statement>
<p>
A potato is placed in an oven, and the potato's temperature <m>F</m> (in degrees Fahrenheit) at various points in time is taken and recorded in the following table. Time <m>t</m> is measured in minutes. In <xref ref="act-1-5-1">Activity</xref>, we computed approximations to <m>F'(30)</m> and <m>F'(60)</m> using central differences. Those values and more are provided in the second table below, along with several others computed in the same way.

<solution>
<p>

<ol label="a.">
  <li><p><m>F'(t)</m> has units measured in degrees Fahrenheit per minute.</p></li>
  <li><p>Using a central difference,
  <me>
    F''(30) \approx \frac{F'(45)-F'(15)}{30} = \frac{2.45-6.03}{30} \approx -0.119.
  </me></p></li>
  <li><p>The value <m>F''(30) \approx -0.119</m>, which is measured in degrees per minute per minute tells us, along with the other data, that at the moment <m>t = 30</m>, the temperature of the potato is 251 degrees, that its temperature is rising at a rate of 3.85 degrees per minute, and that the rate at which the temperature is rising is <em>falling</em> at a rate of -0.119 degrees per minute per minute.  That is, while the temperature is rising, it is rising at a slower and slower rate.  At <m>t = 31</m>, we'd expect that the rate of increase of the potato's temperature would have dropped to about 3.73 degrees per minute.</p></li>
  <li><p>The potato's temperature increasing at a decreasing rate because the values of the first derivative of <m>F</m> are falling.  Equivalently, this is because the value of <m>F''(t)</m> is negative throughout the given time interval.</p></li>
