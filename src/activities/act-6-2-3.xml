<statement>
<p>In each of the following questions, draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described, as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis. In addition, draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice, along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid. It is not necessary to evaluate the integrals you find. For each prompt, use the finite region <m>S</m> in the first quadrant bounded by the curves <m>y = 2x</m> and <m>y = x^3</m>.
