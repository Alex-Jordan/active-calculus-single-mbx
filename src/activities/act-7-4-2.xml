Suppose that a cup of coffee is initially at a temperature of
105<m>^\circ</m> F and is placed in a 75<m>^\circ</m> F room. Newton's law of
cooling says that
<me>
  \frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T-75),
</me>
where <m>k</m> is a constant of proportionality.
	<ol label="a">
		<li><p>Suppose you measure that the coffee is cooling at one degree per
