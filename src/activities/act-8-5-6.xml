                <p>Explain why the Taylor series centered at 0 for <m>e^x</m> converges to <m>e^x</m> for every real number <m>x</m>. Recall that we earlier showed that the Taylor series centered at 0 for <m>e^x</m> converges for all <m>x</m>, and we have now completed the argument that the Taylor series for <m>e^x</m> actually converges to <m>e^x</m> for all <m>x</m>.</p>
