      <p>A dose of morphine is
      absorbed from the bloodstream of a patient at a rate
      proportional to the amount in the bloodstream.

      <ol label="a">
        <li><p>Write a differential equation for <m>M(t)</m>, the amount of
                      morphine in the patient's bloodstream, using <m>k</m> as the
                      constant proportionality.</p></li>

        <li><p>Assuming that the initial dose of morphine is <m>M_0</m>,
                      solve the initial value problem to find <m>M(t)</m>.  Use the
                      fact that the half-life for the absorption of morphine is
                      two hours to find the constant <m>k</m>.</p></li>

        <li><p>Suppose that a patient is given morphine intraveneously
                      at the rate of 3 milligrams per hour.  Write a differential
                      equation that combines the intraveneous administration of
                      morphine with the body's natural absorption.</p></li>

        <li><p>Find any equilibrium solutions and determine their
                      stability.</p></li>

        <li><p>Assuming that there is initially no morphine in the
                      patient's bloodstream, solve the initial value problem to
                      determine <m>M(t)</m>.  What happens to <m>M(t)</m> after a very long time?</p></li>

        <li><p>To what rate should a doctor reduce the
                      intraveneous rate so that there is eventually 7 milligrams
                      of morphine in the patient's bloodstream?</p></li>
