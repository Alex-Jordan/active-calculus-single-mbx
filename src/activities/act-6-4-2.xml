        <li><p>Consider a vertical cylindrical tank of radius 2 meters and depth 6 meters.  Suppose the tank is filled with 4 meters of water of mass density 1000 kg/m<m>^3</m>, and the top 1 meter of water is pumped over the top of the tank.</p></li>

        <li><p>Consider a hemispherical tank with a radius of 10 feet.  Suppose that the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet with water of weight density 62.4 pounds/ft<m>^3</m>, and the top 5 feet of water are pumped out of the tank to a tanker truck whose height is 5 feet above the top of the tank.</p></li>

        <li><p>Consider a trough with triangular ends, as pictured in <xref ref="F-6-4-Act2Trough">Figure</xref>, where the tank is 10 feet long, the top is 5 feet wide, and the tank is 4 feet deep.  Say that the trough is full to within 1 foot of the top with water of weight density 62.4 pounds/ft<m>^3</m>, and a pump is used to empty the tank until the water remaining in the tank is 1 foot deep.</p></li>
