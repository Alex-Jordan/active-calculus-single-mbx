  <introduction>
    <p>In <xref ref="sec-7-2-qualitative">Section</xref>, we saw how a slope field can be used to sketch
      solutions to a differential equation. In particular, the slope field
      is a plot of a large collection of tangent lines to a large number of solutions of the
      differential equation, and we sketch a single solution by simply following
      these tangent lines. With a little more thought, we may use this same
      idea to numerically approximate the solutions of a differential equation.</p>

    <title>Euler's Method</title>
    <p><index><main>Euler's Method</main></index></p>

    <p><xref ref="PA-7-3">Preview Activity</xref> demonstrates the essence of an algorithm known as
      Euler's<fn><q>Euler</q> is pronounced
        <q>Oy-ler.</q>  Among other things, Euler is the mathematician credited with the famous number <m>e</m>; if you incorrectly pronounce his name <q>You-ler,</q> you fail to appreciate his genius and legacy.</fn> Method that generates a numerical approximation to the solution
      of an initial value problem. In this algorithm, we
      will approximate the solution by taking horizontal steps of a fixed
      size that we denote by <m>\Delta t</m>.</p>

    <p>Before explaining the algorithm in detail, let's remember how we
      compute the slope of a line: the slope is the ratio of the vertical
      change to the horizontal change, as shown in <xref ref="F-7-3-slope">Figure</xref>.

<figure xml:id="F-7-3-slope">
    <caption>The role of slope in Euler's Method.</caption>
    <image width="35%" source="images/7_3_slope" />
</figure>

  </p>

    <p>In other words, <m>m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}</m>. From another perspective, the
      vertical change is the product of the slope and the horizontal change, or
      <me>
        \Delta y = m\Delta t.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>Now, suppose that we would like to solve the initial value problem
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = t - y, \ y(0) = 1.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>While there is an algorithm by which we can find an algebraic formula for the solution to this initial value problem, and we can check that this solution is <m>y(t) = t -1 + 2e^{-t}</m>, we are instead interested in generating an approximate solution by creating a sequence
      of points <m>(t_i, y_i)</m>, where <m>y_i\approx y(t_i)</m>. For this first example, we choose <m>\Delta t = 0.2</m>.</p>

    <p>
      Since we know that <m>y(0) = 1</m>, we will take the initial point to be
      <m>(t_0,y_0) = (0,1)</m> and move horizontally by <m>\Delta t = 0.2</m> to the
      point <m>(t_1,y_1)</m>.  Therefore, <m>t_1=t_0+\Delta t = 0.2</m>.
      The differential equation tells us that the slope of the
      tangent line at this point is
      <me>
        m=\frac{dy}{dt}\bigg\vert_{(0,1)} = 0-1 = -1.
      </me>
      Therefore, if we move along the tangent line by taking a horizontal
      step of size <m>\Delta t=0.2</m>, we must also move vertically by
      <me>
        \Delta y = m\Delta t = -1\cdot 0.2 = -0.2.
      </me>
      We then have the
      approximation <m>y(0.2) \approx y_1= y_0 + \Delta y = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.</m>  At this point, we have executed one step of Euler's method, as seen graphically in <xref ref="F-7-3-euler-points-1">Figure</xref>.
          <figure xml:id="F-7-3-euler-points-1">
            <caption>One step of Euler's method.</caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/7_3_euler_points_1" />
          </figure>
      Now we repeat this process:  at <m>(t_1,y_1) = (0.2,0.8)</m>, the
      differential equation tells us that the slope is
      <me>
        m=\frac{dy}{dt}\bigg\vert_{(0.2,0.8)} = 0.2-0.8 = -0.6.
      </me>
      If we move horizontally by <m>\Delta t</m> to <m>t_2=t_1+\Delta = 0.4</m>, we must move
      vertically by
      <me>
        \Delta y = -0.6\cdot0.2 = -0.12.
      </me>
      We consequently arrive at <m>y_2=y_1+\Delta y = 0.8-0.12 = 0.68</m>, which
      gives <m>y(0.2)\approx 0.68</m>.  Now we have completed the second step of Euler's method, as shown in <xref ref="F-7-3-euler-points-2">Figure</xref>.
          <figure xml:id="F-7-3-euler-points-2">
            <caption>Two steps of Euler's method.</caption>
            <image width="50%" source="images/7_3_euler_points_2" />
          </figure>
    </p>

    <p>If we continue in this way, we may generate the points <m>(t_i, y_i)</m>
      shown in <xref ref="F-7-3-Euler-Pts-a">Figure</xref>. In situations where we are able to find a formula for the actual solution <m>y(t)</m>, we can graph <m>y(t)</m> to compare it to the points generated by Euler's method, as shown in <xref ref="F-7-3-Euler-Pts-b">Figure</xref>.</p>

    <p>Because we need to generate a large number of points <m>(t_i,y_i)</m>, it is convenient to organize the implementation of Euler's method in a
      table as shown. We begin with the given initial data.</p>

    <title>The error in Euler's method</title>
    <p><index><main>Euler's Method</main><sub>error</sub></index></p>

    <p>Since we are approximating the solutions to an initial value problem
      using tangent lines, we should expect that the error in the
      approximation will be less when the step size is smaller.
      To explore this observation quantitatively, let's consider the initial value problem
      <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = y, \ y(0) = 1
      </me>
      whose solution we can easily find.</p>

    <p>Consider the question posed by this initial value problem: <q>what function do we know that is the same as its own
      derivative and has value 1 when <m>t=0</m>?</q> It is not hard to see that the
      solution is <m>y(t) = e^t</m>. We now apply Euler's method
      to approximate <m>y(1) = e</m> using several values of <m>\Delta t</m>. These
      approximations will be denoted by <m>E_{\Delta t}</m>, and these estimates provide us a way to see how accurate Euler's Method is.</p>

    <p>To begin, we apply Euler's method with a step size of <m>\Delta t =
      0.2</m>. In that case, we find that <m>y(1) \approx E_{0.2} = 2.4883</m>. The
      error is therefore <me>y(1) - E_{0.2} = e - 2.4883 \approx 0.2300.</me></p>

    <p>Repeatedly halving <m>\Delta t</m> gives the following
      results, expressed in both tabular and graphical form.</p>

    <p>Notice, both numerically and graphically, that the error is roughly halved when <m>\Delta t</m> is halved.
      This example illustrates the following general principle.</p>

    <p>If Euler's method is to approximate the solution to an initial
      value problem at a point <m>\overline{t}</m>, then the error is
      proportional to <m>\Delta t</m>. That is,
      <me>
        y(\overline{t}) - E_{\Delta t} \approx K\Delta t
      </me>
      for some constant of proportionality <m>K</m>.</p>
