<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
Consider the curve given by the equation <m>2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3  + x^2</m>. Find all points at which the tangent line to the curve is horizontal or vertical. Be sure to use a graphing utility to plot this implicit curve and to visually check the results of algebraic reasoning that you use to determine where the tangent lines are horizontal and vertical.

<statement>
<p>
Implicit differentiation enables us a different perspective from which to see why the rule <m>\frac{d}{dx} [a^x] = a^x \ln(a)</m> holds, if we assume that <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}</m>. This exercise leads you through the key steps to do so.
<ol>
<li><p>Let <m>y = a^x</m>.  Rewrite this equation using the natural logarithm function to write <m>x</m> in terms of <m>y</m> (and the constant <m>a</m>).</p></li>
<li><p>Differentiate both sides of the equation you found in (a) with respect to <m>x</m>, keeping in mind that <m>y</m> is implicitly a function of <m>x</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the equation you found in (b) for <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, and then use the definition of <m>y</m> to write <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> solely in terms of <m>x</m>.  What have you found?</p></li>
