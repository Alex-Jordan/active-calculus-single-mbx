        <statement>
          <p>The tide removes sand from the beach at a small ocean park at a rate modeled by the function
            <me>
              R(t) = 2 + 5\sin \left( \frac{4\pi t}{25} \right)
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>A pumping station adds sand to the beach at rate modeled by the function
            <me>
              S(t) = \frac{15t}{1+3t}
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>Both <m>R(t)</m> and <m>S(t)</m> are measured in cubic yards of sand per hour, <m>t</m> is measured in hours, and the valid times are <m>0 \le t \le 6</m>. At time <m>t = 0</m>, the beach holds 2500 cubic yards of sand.

          <ol>
            <li><p>What definite integral measures how much sand the tide will remove during the time period <m>0 \le t \le 6</m>?  Why?</p></li>

            <li><p>Write an expression for <m>Y(x)</m>, the total number of cubic yards of sand on the beach at time <m>x</m>.  Carefully explain your thinking and reasoning.</p></li>

            <li><p>At what instantaneous rate is the total number of cubic yards of sand on the beach at time <m>t = 4</m> changing?</p></li>

            <li><p>Over the time interval <m>0 \le t \le 6</m>, at what time <m>t</m> is the amount of sand on the beach least?  What is this minimum value?  Explain and justify your answers fully.</p></li>

        <statement>
          <p>When an aircraft attempts to climb as rapidly as
            possible, its climb rate (in feet per minute) decreases as altitude
            increases, because the air is less dense at higher altitudes.
            Given below is a table showing performance data for a certain
            single engine aircraft, giving its climb rate at various altitudes, where <m>c(h)</m> denotes the climb rate of the airplane at an altitude <m>h</m>.
