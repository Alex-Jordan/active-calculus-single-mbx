  <statement>
  <p>
  A cup of coffee has its temperature <m>F</m> (in degrees Fahrenheit) at time <m>t</m> given by the function <m>F(t) = 75 + 110 e^{-0.05t}</m>, where time is measured in minutes.
  <ol>
  <li><p>Use a central difference with <m>h = 0.01</m> to estimate the value of <m>F'(10)</m>.</p></li>
  <li><p>What are the units on the value of <m>F'(10)</m> that you computed in (a)?  What is the practical meaning of the value of <m>F'(10)</m>?</p></li>
  <li><p>Which do you expect to be greater: <m>F'(10)</m> or <m>F'(20)</m>?  Why?</p></li>
  <li><p>Write a sentence that describes the behavior of the function <m>y = F'(t)</m> on the time interval <m>0 \le t \le 30</m>.  How do you think its graph will look?  Why?</p></li>

  <statement>
  <p>
  The temperature change <m>T</m> (in Fahrenheit degrees), in a patient, that is generated by a dose <m>q</m> (in milliliters), of a drug, is given by the function <m>T = f(q)</m>.
  <ol>
  <li><p>What does it mean to say <m>f(50) = 0.75</m>?  Write a complete sentence to explain, using correct units.</p></li>
  <li><p>A person's sensitivity, <m>s</m>, to the drug is defined by the function <m>s(q) = f'(q)</m>.  What are the units of sensitivity?</p></li>
  <li><p>Suppose that <m>f'(50) = -0.02</m>.  Write a complete sentence to explain the meaning of this value.  Include in your response the information given in (a).</p></li>

  <statement>
  <p>
  The velocity of a ball that has been tossed vertically in the air is given by <m>v(t) = 16 - 32t</m>, where <m>v</m> is measured in feet per second, and <m>t</m> is measured in seconds. The ball is in the air from <m>t = 0</m> until <m>t = 2</m>.
  <ol>
  <li><p>When is the ball's velocity greatest?</p></li>
  <li><p>Determine the value of <m>v'(1)</m>.  Justify your thinking.</p></li>
  <li><p>What are the units on the value of <m>v'(1)</m>?  What does this value and the corresponding units tell you about the behavior of the ball at time <m>t = 1</m>?</p></li>
  <li><p>What is the physical meaning of the function <m>v'(t)</m>?</p></li>

  <statement>
  <p>
  The value, <m>V</m>, of a particular automobile (in dollars) depends on the number of miles, <m>m</m>, the car has been driven, according to the function <m>V = h(m)</m>.
  <ol>
  <li><p>Suppose that <m>h(40000) = 15500</m> and <m>h(55000) = 13200</m>.  What is the average rate of change of <m>h</m> on the interval <m>[40000,55000]</m>, and what are the units on this value?</p></li>
  <li><p>In addition to the information given in (a), say that <m>h(70000) = 11100</m>.  Determine the best possible estimate of <m>h'(55000)</m> and write one sentence to explain the meaning of your result, including units on your answer.</p></li>
  <li><p>Which value do you expect to be greater: <m>h'(30000)</m> or <m>h'(80000)</m>?  Why?</p></li>
  <li><p>Write a sentence to describe the long-term behavior of the function <m>V = h(m)</m>, plus another sentence to describe the long-term behavior of <m>h'(m)</m>.  Provide your discussion in practical terms regarding the value of the car and the rate at which that value is changing.</p></li>
